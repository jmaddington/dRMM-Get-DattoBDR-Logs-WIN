# Overview #
This repo is a starter dRMM component.

Please note that it does change and evolve. In particular, I hope to update the build script to be a little more robust.

# Usage #
Run initialize\init1.ps1 interactively to build a new resource.xml

CD into .\build and run build\repackage.bat to turn it into an importable dRMM component.

# Building #
Download or fork, run repackage.bat and upload aem-component.cpt to dRMM. You can also download the aem-component.cpt straight from this repository and install in your dRMM instance.
